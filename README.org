* org-minutes

=org-minutes= supports taking and exporting minutes. =org-minutes= assumes a very simple but effective minutes format consisting of plain lists, where list items can be typed and assigned to participants using the dictionary notation of =org-mode= lists. 

** Installation

** Usage

*** The basic list format  

=org-minutes= consist of *one* arbitrarily deeply embedded list, where the topmost level is an enumeration (=1)=, =2)=, ...).  

=org-minutes= items have the following structure

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1) (I:? <NAMES>? <SEPARATOR>)? <CONTENT>  
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- (<TYPE>? <NAMES>? <SEPARATOR>)? <CONTENT>
#+END_EXAMPLE

which means:
- =<TYPE>= is the type of the item. There is a choice of item types built in:  
   | <TYPE>         | description   |
   |--------------+---------------|
   | =A:=, =[ ]=  | action/agenda |
   | =D:=, =E:=   | decision      |
   | =I:=         | information   |
   | =C:=         | consultation  |
   | =CA:=, =[X]= | cleared       |
- =<NAMES>= is a comma-separated list of participant names.
- =<SEPARATOR>= can be =::= or =||=.
- When =<TYPE>= or =<NAMES>= are given, there also has to be a =<SEPARATOR>=.
- When =<NAMES>= but not =<TYPE>= is given, the implicit type will be =I:= (information).

*** Keywords

There is a number of special =org-minutes= keywords that are used during export:

| keywords                  | description |
|---------------------------+-------------|
| =#+MINUTES-TITLE:=        |  title of the document; used as =#+TITLE:= |
| =#+MINUTES-EVENT:=        |  name of the event |
| =#+MINUTES-PLACE:=        |  place of the event |
| =#+MINUTES-DATE:=         |  used as =#+DATE:= |
| =#+MINUTES-AUTHOR:=       | name of minute taker; used as =#+AUTHOR:= |
| =#+MINUTES-CHAIR:=        | chair of the event |
