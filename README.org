* org-fm

=org-fm= supports taking and exporting minutes in =org-mode= files. =org-fm= assumes a very simple but effective minutes format consisting of plain lists, where list items can be typed and assigned to participants using the dictionary notation of =org-mode= lists.

** Installation

*** Installation with Melpa

Not yet available.

*** Installation from Github

Download =org-fm.el= to your =.emacs.d= folder and add the following code to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package org-fm
  :load-path "relative/path/to/org-fm/"
  :config
  (org-fm-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC

For LaTeX export, you will also need =org-fm-latex-style-plain.tex=.

** Usage

*** The basic list format  

Minutes taken with =org-fm= consist of *one* arbitrarily deeply embedded list, where the topmost level is an enumeration (=1)=, =2)=, ...).  

=org-fm= items have the following structure

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
1) (I:? <TIMESTAMP>? <NAMES>? <SEPARATOR>)? <CONTENT>  
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- (<TYPE>? <TIMESTAMP>? <NAMES>? <SEPARATOR>)? <CONTENT>
#+END_EXAMPLE

which means:
- =<TYPE>= is the type of the item. There is a choice of item types built in:  
   | <TYPE>   | description           |
   |----------+-----------------------|
   | =A:=, =[ ]=  | action/agenda         |
   | =AC:=, =[X]= | cleared               |
   | =D:=, =E:=   | decision/Entscheidung |
   | =C:=, =B:=   | consultation/Beratung |
   | =I:=       | information           |
   | =N:=       | note                  |
   | =Q:=       | open question about minutes |
- =<TIMESTAMP>= is an (inactive) =org-timestamp=.
- =<NAMES>= is a comma-separated list of participant names.
- =<SEPARATOR>= can be =::= or =||=.
- When =<TYPE>=, =<TIMESTAMP>= or =<NAMES>= are given, there also has to be a =<SEPARATOR>=.
- When =<NAMES>= but not =<TYPE>= is given, the implicit type will be =I:= (information).

**** Timestamps

Items may contain an inactive =org-timestamp=, which is located after =<TYPE>= and before =<NAMES>=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- N: [2020-06-08 Mo 12:18] :: This is a note.
#+END_EXAMPLE 

Timestamps can be inserted or updated with =org-fm-add-or-update-timestamp=.

Timestamps are not exported with =org-fm-export= except for the note type (=N:=).

*** Inline elements

=org-fm= also provides two types of inline elements:

| inline element            | description            |
|---------------------------+------------------------|
| enclosed by =?:= and =:?= | question about minutes |
| enclosed by =#:= and =:#= | private comment        |
| enclosed by =!:= and =:!= | alert   |

*** Keywords

There is a number of special =org-fm= keywords that are used during export:

| keywords                | description                             |
|-------------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| =#+MINUTES_TITLE:=        | title of the document; used as =#+TITLE:= |
| =#+MINUTES_EVENT:=        | name of the event                       |
| =#+MINUTES_PLACE:=        | place of the event                      |
| =#+MINUTES_DATE:=         | date of the event; used as =#+DATE:=      |
| =#+MINUTES_AUTHOR:=       | name of minute taker; used as =#+AUTHOR:= |
| =#+MINUTES_CHAIR:=        | chair of the event                      |
| =#+MINUTES_DRAFT-TEXT:=   | text of the draft watermark             |
| =#+MINUTES_PARTICIPANTS:= | names of participants                   |
| =#+MINUTES_LANGUAGE:=     | language of minutes                     |
| =#+MINUTES_LATEX_STYLE:=  | name of \LaTeX style file               |
| =#+MINUTES_OPTIONS:=      | used as =#+OPTIONS:=                      |

Participants can be included using the drawer =:PARTICIPANTS-LIST:= which is assumed to contain exactly one list. The content of =:PARTICIPANTS-LIST:= will overwrite =#+MINUTES_PARTICIPANTS:=.

The schema of the participation list looks like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- <CHECKBOX> <NAME> [<ABBREVIATION>]
  - <COMMENT>?
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that, currently, *only one* comment item per participant is supported when exporting to LaTeX.

*** Automatic abbreviation expansion

=org-fm= lets you easily define abbreviations of participant names that are expanded during export.

Within =:PARTICIPANTS-LIST:=, abbreviations (and optionally expansions) can be specified in square brackets:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- [X] Susan Parker [SP=Sue]
- [ ] Kim Miller [KM]
#+END_EXAMPLE 

When no expansion is given, either the part preceding a comma (,) or the last word in the preceding name will be used.

One can mask abbreviations (and suppress their expansion) by prefixing it with  =##=, which will be removed during expansion.

*** Example

See [[file:example.org][example.org]].

*** Export

The export is triggered with =org-fm-export=.

=org-fm-export= will first copy the content of the =org-mode= heading at point into a temporary buffer, perform a couple of replacements and then call =org-export-dispatch=. 

** Plans

- [X] add easy way to include the time
- [X] add automatic expansion of abbreviations
      - instad use links? https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Hyperlinks#Hyperlink_and_Hypertarget
            - Full name is given in the link label.
- [ ] activate faces only in headings with minutes?
- [ ] check in and ckeck out participants
